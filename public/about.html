<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Jared graduated from Western Washington University with a degree in business administration with a concentration in marketing.
  But his true passion and calling in life has been performing as an actor. Jared is a proud member of SAG-AFTRA having joined
  in 2019 after making his feature film debut in Kelly Reichardt's "First Cow" for A24.</p>

<p>As passionate as he is about acting and the art of filmaking, Jared couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing from his life.
  He was missing the unique creative outlet and strategic way of thinking that working as a marketer could provide. After all, effective marketers must be
  incredible storytellers. One look at Ryan Reynolds is evidence enough of this fact. Great marketing doesn't exist without phenomenal storytelling.
</p>

<p> However, the worlds of business, marketing, and storytelling are colliding with the digital world at blistering speeds. Content is everywhere. Everyone and everything has
  a story to tell and thanks to social media and the permeation of the internet into every facet of our lives, Jared became curious as to how it all works at its most basic level.
  And so began his journey into the world of coding starting with the question, "What in the world is html?". What he discovered is that html is the foundation of the internet.
</p>

<p> So here we are, at the beginning of Jared's journey as a web developer. This site, a rudimentary html portfolio reminiscent of the 90's (or earlier... who knows? Html is ancient.),
  will serve as the living ecosystem of Jared's path to knowledge and mastery that will hopefully culminate in his ability to utilize his skills as a storyteller, a marketer, and a 
  coder to become the ultimate digital creator.

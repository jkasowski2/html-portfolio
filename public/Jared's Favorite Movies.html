<h1>The Best Movies I've Ever Seen</h1>
<h2>Top three movies of all time according to Jared Kasowski </h2>
 <hr />
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h3>
<p>The epic conclusion to Tolkien's tale of Frodo destroying the One Ring. <br /> I highly recommend watching the extended addition to get the full experience.
</p>
<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>Usually musicals are made for broadway and adapted to the screen. But this musical was born for the screen. <br /> Make sure to bring a box of tissues. This fantastic film is a tear jerker.
</p>
<h3>The Mummy</h3>
<p>Action, adventure, horror and comedy. What more could you ask for? <br /> This movie has it all.</p>
